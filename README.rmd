## Overview <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="138" />

BarnebyLives! is an R program which serves to help botanical collectors in Western North America. BarnebyLives! runs multiple types of queries to acquire political and administrative, geographic, and taxonomic data for recently collected herbarium specimens. It also has limited abilities to search for taxonomic synonyms, check spelling of family, genus, and species names, as well as author abbreviations.  

BarnebyLives! serves the entirety of the flora of the western conterminous US, which coincides with the Mississippi River. It also includes the entirety of the state of Illinois, and portions of Indiana. However, the area is bounded on it's North by Canada and South by Mexico, essentially it covers the western portion of the Conterminous United States (which excludes Alaska). While it covers this range, most variables are focused on supporting botanists working West of the Rocky Mountain Front Range, especially those operating on Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service administered lands.

BarnebyLives! Is meant to *supplement*, not supplant, collectors field note endeavors. Variables which BarnebyLives! may produce, automatically, for each collection includes:

**Political**  
- State  
- County   
- Township  
- Public Land Survey System (township, range, section)  

**Geographic**
- Mountain Range (if relevant)  
- Nearest Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) place name, and distance and azimuth from it  

**Site characteristics**  
- Elevation (both meters and feet)  
- Slope  
- Aspect  
- Surficial geology  
- Geomorphon (major landform elements) 

**Taxonomic**  
- Spell check for Family, Genus, and specific epithet 
- Searches for synonym to species  
- Spell checks taxonomic authorities
- Spell check for associated species

**Directions**  
- directions to a parking spot can be acquired from Google Maps; however this implies the location can be driven to in the first place.

**Other features include**   
- Date parsing, e.g. convert date into congruent museum formats (month in European style)  
- Conversion of Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS) to Decimal Degrees (DD)  
- Exporting collection data as a 'shapefile' or KML for use in a GIS or GoogleEarth

**Label and shipping manifest generation**
- Herbarium Labels which autopopulate from the script output
- Manifests which autopopulate from the script outputs
- Herbarium labels with retro dot municipality maps

**Electronic data for mass digital specimen upload**
- Puts out data in formats congruent with Symbiota, Darwincore, Rocky Moutain Herbarium, and Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria. 

Currently BarnebyLives! Is being run on a juiced up computer either in Rogers Park Chicago or Reno. The amount of data which it queries is very large. Please let me know if you have a query and I will run it for you. If you only collect from a smaller portion of the West, e.g. a certain state, or FS/BLM Unit/Field Office, you should be able to set up a local instance. Although, the documentation for such an endeavor is nascent the endeavor is simple, see "crop2boundary" for the workflow. 

## Installation

BarnebyLives! is in beta testing, and can currently only be installed as 0.1.0 from github. 
```r
devtools::install_github('sagesteppe/BarnebyLives')
```
The generation of labels will requires that Rmarkdown is succesfully set up to render to PDF via a LaTeX distribution such as pdflatex, lualatex, xelatex.

Labels will further require two programs, pdfjam and pdftk. These can be installed on Debian flavors of Linux as so:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pdfjam -y
sudo apt-get install pdftk -y
```

We hope to collaborate with others to treat CONUS and to create multiformat data e.g. Darwincore, CPNWH, etc., and push this product onto CRAN as well as publish a short piece in APPS! It is on the backburner, but still simmering! Stay tuned in but dropped out!

## Input Data Column Names

The columns in the top table are **required** to run the all the functions in BarnebyLives. The columns in the middle table are suggested to increase the quality of the collections.  The columns in the lower table are optional, to be blunt, BarnebyLives will generate all of these values. Ficticious examples are provided here, while links to real examples (over 100) are contained [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR8I-JBcgA7P9RYjJqbTebzNFLS1bLz1sYVW1vPlU5Bq6WXCwKS4zkeGTCmlo9BcznCKNbdz6gtK9pV/pubhtml) and in the vignettes.

## General Workflow 

![Suggested Workflow](man/figures/workflow.png) 

## Geodata directory structure
For those that are setting up a local instance the directory structure for the geodata is flat. 
```
$ tree -d
geodata
├── allotments
├── aspect
├── elevation
├── geology
├── geomorphons
├── mountains
├── pad
├── places
├── plss
├── political
└── slope
```
Several of these sub-directories are quite large. In total my local instance takes up around 16gb of data.

```
$ du -h
708M	./geology
73M	./political
3.8M	./mountains
136M	./allotments
435M	./pad
4.6G	./slope
81M	./places
816M	./plss
4.2G	./elevation
4.1G	./aspect
455M	./geomorphons
16G	.
```
As you can see the data regarding site physical characteristics take up most of space. 
Because of this you can download data to a directory which you find suitable.
Personally, I slap all of them on an hdd.

## Rendering Labels

BL provides three template labels, each of which are distributed from within the package and copied to their final location using the following commands in R. 
```
p2libs <- system.file(package = 'BarnebyLives')
folds <- file.path('rmarkdown', 'templates', 'labels', 'skeleton', 'SoS-skeleton.Rmd') 

file.copy(from = file.path(p2libs, folds), 
          to = '.') # change for wherever you want the label to go. 
```

You will need to print you labels for the sheets. 
We use a `purrr` `walk`  to create 4x4in individuals labels as pdf's using Rmarkdown. 
Then we combine all of them using bash. 
A bash script, `render_labels.sh` is distributed with the package to accomplish this. 

We can copy it to a location, from R, like this. 

```
p2libs <- system.file(package = 'BarnebyLives')
folds <- file.path('rmarkdown', 'render_labels.sh') 

file.copy(from = file.path(p2libs, folds), 
          to = '/media/steppe/hdd/Barneby_Lives-dev/manuscript/labels/raw')
```

And once here, we can run it like this (from a shell!)

```
bash render_labels.sh collector='Dwight'
```

Note that, we've had difficulty calling this script from it's default install location :/, but it can easily be copied elsewhere and ran from that location. 

reminder, you only need to chmod +x a file if you don't call 'bash' at the start of an argument...
```
chmod +x render_labels.sh
path2file/render_labels.sh collector='Dwight'
```
Also a reminder that you can check your paths via `$PATH`, and can install to somewhere on your path! e.g. '/usr/local/bin', after that you can simply call it... But I'm not sure if it will find the dir you are looking for. 
```
render_labels.sh collector='Dwight'
```
In all instances the script is meant for you to call it from the following location:
```
├── HerbariumLabels
│  ├── final ## <- products will go in here!!! 
│  └── raw ## <- call render_labels.sh from here!!!
│       └── Dwight-raw
```
The labels will end up in 'final' and the subfolder within raw ('Dwight-raw') will be deleted.
If you want to re-render you'll need to run the `purrr::walk` again. 

Note that the 'collector' will need to match (..exactly...) the output of the `purrr::walk` files collector name. 

## Trouble printing? 

Some printers (maybe not updating drivers enough?) have trouble printing LaTeX (in general, not related to this package). 
```
ps2pdf labels_in.pdf labels_out-ps2pdf.pdf
```
Has worked for me.
