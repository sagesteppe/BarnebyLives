# Import Google directions to a site

Use Google Maps to write directions to a site, so that the people
re-locating the site don't need to use Google Maps to write directions
to a site. These are crude and will require some refinement for some
relevant applications. This function operates entirely within
'directions_grabber'

## Usage

``` r
specificDirections(x)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  the output of directions_grabber

## Examples

# see 'directions_grabber'#
```
