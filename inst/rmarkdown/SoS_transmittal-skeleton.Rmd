Dear `r herbarium$name`

We at `r project$organization` are transferring these materials to `r herbarium$name` to serve as vouchers for the `r project$name` project. 

This package contains the following specimens and labels for them in a manilla envelope.

```{r Specimen table, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
knitr::kable()
```


Thank you, we appreciate your assistance in this matter. 

Sincerely,

`r project$contact_person`, `r project$contact_phone`
`r project$contact_email`
