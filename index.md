BarnebyLives! is an R program which serves to help botanical collectors
in Western North America. BarnebyLives! runs multiple types of queries
to acquire political and administrative, geographic, and taxononomic
data for recently collected herbarium specimens. It also has limited
abilities to search for taxonomic synonyms, check spelling of family,
genus, and species names, as well as author abbreviations.
