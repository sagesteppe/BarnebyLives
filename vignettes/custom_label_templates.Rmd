## Overview 
Obviously, everyone wants to be able to customize their label templates! 
Why go through the bother of installing and running `BarnebyLives` if you cannot do that! 
So here are a couple examples of tweaking around with the default skeleton to get some labels which will... Look familiar. 

Note that the labels are made using LaTeX, an awesome guide for LaTeX (relevant to the level you will be using it at) is [Overleaf.org](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes), and check the links in the side bar too! 

In this vignette, I will show you what the three default templates look like, and then we will make some slight customizations to them. 

## Examples 

As a reminder, the standard template (`skeleton.Rmd`) looks like this. 

Another included template, for the Seeds of Success program (`skeletonSOS.Rmd`), looks like this. 
Seeds of Success is a rad program all about how plant science will save the planet. 
This collection didn't lead to a collection, but I am largely indebted to it for a ton of testing data from a whole slew of collectors (holla @ Chicago Botanic Garden & University of Nevada Reno too!)

And our final default template (`skeleton-new.Rmd`) looks like this

## Modifications

```{r, eval =F}
library(BarnebyLives)
library(tidyverse)

local <- file.path('~', 'Documents', 'assoRted', 'Barneby_Lives_dev', 'LabelStyles')

l.nevadense <- collection_examples |>
  filter(Collection_number == 2823)

write.csv(l.nevadense, file.path(local, 'SoS-ExampleCollection.csv'))
```

All of the labels can be copied from their original locations using the following code.  

```{r copy a template to a local directory, eval = F}
p2lib <- file.path(
  system.file(package = 'BarnebyLives'),
  'rmarkdown', 'templates', 'labels', 'skeleton'
  )

# here we copy over one of the skeletons which we are going to modify in this example
file.copy(
  from = file.path(p2lib, 'SoS-skeleton.Rmd'), 
  to = file.path(local, 'SoS-skeleton.Rmd')
  )

rm(p2lib)
```

When using the program you will need to copy a template from it's location within the package to a 'local' location. 
This is because you will *always* need to modify a small part of the skeleton which defines where the document should *look* for your data it will put on the labels, see the 'creating_labels' vignette for details. 
Any changes you make to the skeleton's in the package directory will be lost anytime you update the package. 
Once the file is in that location it can easily be opened for safe editing. 
So by 'local' I basically mean put the file in a location on your computer which will not be overwritten when you update the package, which may happen without your knowledge if this becomes a dependency to another package (which seems highly unlikely to me). 
Obviously it's good to try and place all of these skeletons in the same location so you don't have to do much hunting around to find them, the 'spaces' in LaTeX formatting can make things go haywire quick, so it's nice to have a backup version as you are tailoring a version.  

While I am about to be very busy for the next few years I am happy to accept pull requests so that BL has a greater variety of herbarium templates, likewise you can make your own `writer_*` type functions and push those to the package. 
If you have questions about how to do this, many good github resources/guides exist, and i am happy to try and help with incorporating materials. 

```{r run labels, echo = F, eval = F}
purrr::walk(
  .x = l.nevadense$Collection_number,
  ~ rmarkdown::render(
    input = file.path(local, 'SoS-skeleton.Rmd'), 
    output_file = file.path(local, paste0('default-SOS-', glue::glue("{.x}.pdf"))), 
    params = list(Collection_number = {.x}) 
  )
)

purrr::walk(
  .x = l.nevadense$Collection_number,
  ~ rmarkdown::render(
    input = file.path(local, 'SoS-skeleton-Spaced.Rmd'), 
    output_file = file.path(local, paste0('Spaced-SOS-', glue::glue("{.x}.pdf"))), 
    params = list(Collection_number = {.x}) 
  )
)

purrr::walk(
  .x = l.nevadense$Collection_number,
  ~ rmarkdown::render(
    input = file.path(local, 'SoS-skeleton-noDir.Rmd'), 
    output_file = file.path(local, paste0('noDir-SOS-', glue::glue("{.x}.pdf"))), 
    params = list(Collection_number = {.x}) 
  )
)

purrr::walk(
  .x = l.nevadense$Collection_number,
  ~ rmarkdown::render(
    input = file.path(local, 'SoS-skeleton-large.Rmd'), 
    output_file = file.path(local, paste0('large-SOS-', glue::glue("{.x}.pdf"))), 
    params = list(Collection_number = {.x}) 
  )
)

purrr::walk(
  .x = l.nevadense$Collection_number,
  ~ rmarkdown::render(
    input = file.path(local, 'SoS-skeleton-familyLeft.Rmd'), 
    output_file = file.path(local, paste0('familyLeft-SOS-', glue::glue("{.x}.pdf"))), 
    params = list(Collection_number = {.x}) 
  )
)

purrr::walk(
  .x = l.nevadense$Collection_number,
  ~ rmarkdown::render(
    input = file.path(local, 'SoS-skeleton-Det.Rmd'), 
    output_file = file.path(local, paste0('Det-SOS-', glue::glue("{.x}.pdf"))), 
    params = list(Collection_number = {.x}) 
  )
)
```

One final note is that LaTeX uses *spaces*, or ' ' for controlling content. 
In particular two spaces will force the text onto a new line. 
It is hard for me illustrate these in the examples, but I'll try and do my best to mention them when relevant. 

For this example we will focus on the final default template, which is a pretty middle of the road design.

Hmm that's a busy label, we could try and reduce the directions manually... 
Or, we can just rid of them! 
Around line 50 we can just remove the following details. 

```{r remove directions, eval = F}
\begingroup
\begin{spacing}{0.1}
{\scriptsize `r data$Directions_BL`}
\end{spacing}
\endgroup
```

Delete this!

<br> 

![*No directions*](../man/figures/noDir-SOS-2823-1.png)

That looks better! But now that we can, I want to open up some space between the habitat notes and vegetation information. 
It's simple, all we need is to empty a blank line to the document

```{r add a space, eval = F}
\begingroup
`r data$Gen`. `r writer(data$Site)` `r data$latitude_dd` `r data$longitude_dd` (`r data$Datum` `r writer(data$Coordinate_Uncertainty)`).

`r writer(data$Habitat)`. `r data$physical_environ`  
Veg.: `r species_font(data$Vegetation)` `r associates_writer(data$Associates)`
`r writer(data$Notes)`  
\endgroup
```

Can become the chunk below. All we do is enter a blank line between 'r writer()...' and 'Veg.'

```{r add a space do it, eval = F}
\begingroup
`r data$Gen`. `r writer(data$Site)` `r data$latitude_dd` `r data$longitude_dd` (`r data$Datum` `r writer(data$Coordinate_Uncertainty)`).

`r writer(data$Habitat)`. `r data$physical_environ`  

Veg.: `r species_font(data$Vegetation)` `r associates_writer(data$Associates)`
`r writer(data$Notes)`  
\endgroup
```

![*Space between habitat and vegetation*](../man/figures/Spaced-SOS-2823-1.png)  

<br> 
That's better!

> "All I want is to breathe I'm too thin"  
> "Won't you breathe with me?"   
> "Find a little space, so we can move in-between In-Between it"  
> "And keep one step ahead, of yourself."  

<br> 
Now let's change the line that controls the size of the font for the project name. 
Here we will be making the font size smaller by shifting from the `LARGE` to the `large` argument.   

```{r upper case project, eval = F}
\textbf{\LARGE `r writer(data$Project_Name)`}  
```

```{r title case project, eval = F}
\textbf{\large `r writer(data$Project_Name)`} 
```

![*Smaller project name*](../man/figures/large-SOS-2823-1.png)  

<br>

Here we change the location of the family on the label (currently aligned right). 
Let's make the family left aligned.  
Note that all calls to R are in a single set of smart quotes, and 'R', this allows us to run R commands without having to create a code chunk for them in the more common markdown syntax. 
We have created a few commands which help format the writing output for making the labels like nice. 

```{r family at right, eval = F}
\begin{flushright}
\uppercase{`r data$Family`}
\end{flushright}

\begingroup
\large
`r writer(paste(data$Genus, data$Epithet), italics = TRUE)` `r writer(data$Binomial_authority)` `r writer(data$Infrarank)` `r  writer(data$Infraspecies, italics = TRUE)` `r writer(data$Infraspecific_authority)`  
\endgroup
\normalsize
```

If you remove the `flushright` commands you basically end up with this:  

```{r family at left, eval = F}

\large
\uppercase{`r data$Family`}  
\begingroup
`r writer(paste(data$Genus, data$Epithet), italics = TRUE)` `r writer(data$Binomial_authority)` `r writer(data$Infrarank)` `r  writer(data$Infraspecies, italics = TRUE)` `r writer(data$Infraspecific_authority)`  
\endgroup
\normalsize

```

This requires us to delete the first three lines while we copy the family down into the 'group'. 
Which brings up a good point, these 'groups' are used to more or less create elements held together like paragraphs. 
If we had omitted to bring family into the group, there would be a smidge more space between it and the scientific name (as exemplified with the habitat and vegetation alterations.)

![*Family to the left*](../man/figures/familyLeft-SOS-2823-1.png)  

<br>

We may also decide that we want to put determination information right under the species. 
We can do that by just moving these elements around.
(Be sure to delete the call to `writer_fide` from the chunk located all the way near the bottom of the skeleton!).

```{r determination, eval=F}
\begingroup
`r collection_writer(data)`. `r writer_fide(data)`
\endgroup
```

And bring it up to where the scientific name is printed, and make the font for the det info smaller. 

```{r remove fide, eval=F}
\begingroup
\large
`r writer(paste(data$Genus, data$Epithet), italics = TRUE)` `r writer(data$Binomial_authority)` `r writer(data$Infrarank)` `r  writer(data$Infraspecies, italics = TRUE)` `r writer(data$Infraspecific_authority)`  
\normalsize
`r writer_fide(data)`
\endgroup
```


![*Determination at top of label*](../man/figures/Det-SOS-2823-1.png)  

<br>

Obviously, the way I enter data for determination would be bad for this! using my initials after my full name makes sense, in this context, who the hell is "RCB" you would wonder? I am one in a sea of botanists named 'Reed', and certainly other - more illustrious - RCB's are out there. 

## In summary 

This is an odd vignette to create because it relies on multiple languages, especially one where ' ' spaces are *very* important. 
Just bear in mind you can make big changes to labels with small steps (maybe too small?)!
The overleaf guide has https://www.overleaf.com/learn everything you need, and you'll probably realize this pales in comparision.
