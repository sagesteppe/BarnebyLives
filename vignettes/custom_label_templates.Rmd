## Overview 
Obviously, everyone wants to be able to customize their label templates! 
Why go through the bother of installing and running `BarnebyLives` if you cannot do that! 
So here are a couple examples of tweaking around with the default skeleton to get some labels which will... Look familiar. 

Note that the labels are made using LaTeX, an awesome guide for LaTeX (relevant to the level you will be using it at) is [Overleaf.org](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes), and check the links in the side bar too! 

In this vignette, I will show you what the three default templates look like, and then we will make some slight customizations to them. 

## Examples 

As a reminder, the standard template (`skeleton.Rmd`) looks like this. 


Another included template, for the Seeds of Success program (`skeletonSOS.Rmd`), looks like this. 
Seeds of Success is a rad program all about how plant science will save the planet. 
This collection didn't lead to a collection, but I am largely indebted to it for a ton of testing data from a whole slew of collectors (holla @ Chicago Botanic Garden & University of Nevada Reno too!)


And our final default template (`skeleton-new.Rmd`) looks like this


## Modifications

```{r, eval =F}
library(BarnebyLives)
library(tidyverse)

local <- file.path('~', 'Documents', 'assoRted', 'Barneby_Lives_dev', 'LabelStyles')

l.nevadense <- collection_examples |>
  filter(Collection_number == 2823)

write.csv(l.nevadense, file.path(local, 'SoS-ExampleCollection.csv'))
```

All of the labels can be copied from their original locations using the following code

```{r copy a template to a local directory, eval = F}

p2lib <- file.path(
  system.file(package = 'BarnebyLives'),
  'rmarkdown', 'templates', 'labels', 'skeleton'
  )

# here we copy over one of the skeletons which we are going to modify in this example
file.copy(
  from = file.path(p2lib, 'SoS-skeleton.Rmd'), 
  to = file.path(local, 'SoS-skeleton.Rmd')
  )

rm(p2libs, folds)
```

If you want to customize one, be sure to keep it in a 'local' location on your computer which will not be overwritten when you update the package, which may happen without your knowledge if this becomes a dependency to another package (which seems highly unlikely to me). 
Once the file is in that location it can easily be opened for safe editing. 

```{r run labels, echo = F, eval = F}
purrr::walk(
  .x = l.nevadense$Collection_number,
  ~ rmarkdown::render(
    input = file.path(local, 'SoS-skeleton.Rmd'), 
    output_file = file.path(local, paste0('default-SOS-', glue::glue("{.x}.pdf"))), 
    params = list(Collection_number = {.x}) 
  )
)

purrr::walk(
  .x = l.nevadense$Collection_number,
  ~ rmarkdown::render(
    input = file.path(local, 'SoS-skeleton-Spaced.Rmd'), 
    output_file = file.path(local, paste0('Spaced-SOS-', glue::glue("{.x}.pdf"))), 
    params = list(Collection_number = {.x}) 
  )
)

purrr::walk(
  .x = l.nevadense$Collection_number,
  ~ rmarkdown::render(
    input = file.path(local, 'SoS-skeleton-noDir.Rmd'), 
    output_file = file.path(local, paste0('noDir-SOS-', glue::glue("{.x}.pdf"))), 
    params = list(Collection_number = {.x}) 
  )
)

purrr::walk(
  .x = l.nevadense$Collection_number,
  ~ rmarkdown::render(
    input = file.path(local, 'SoS-skeleton-large.Rmd'), 
    output_file = file.path(local, paste0('large-SOS-', glue::glue("{.x}.pdf"))), 
    params = list(Collection_number = {.x}) 
  )
)

purrr::walk(
  .x = l.nevadense$Collection_number,
  ~ rmarkdown::render(
    input = file.path(local, 'SoS-skeleton-familyLeft.Rmd'), 
    output_file = file.path(local, paste0('familyLeft-SOS-', glue::glue("{.x}.pdf"))), 
    params = list(Collection_number = {.x}) 
  )
)

purrr::walk(
  .x = l.nevadense$Collection_number,
  ~ rmarkdown::render(
    input = file.path(local, 'SoS-skeleton-Det.Rmd'), 
    output_file = file.path(local, paste0('Det-SOS-', glue::glue("{.x}.pdf"))), 
    params = list(Collection_number = {.x}) 
  )
)
```

One final note is that LaTeX uses *spaces*, or ' ' for controlling content. 
In particular two spaces will force the text onto a new line. 
It is hard for me illustrate these in the examples, but I'll try and do my best to mention them when relevant. 

For this example we will focus on the final default template, which is a pretty middle of the road design. 

![Default SOS template results](../man/figures/default-SOS-2823-1.png)

Hmm that's a busy label, we could try and reduce the directions manually... Or, we can just rid of them! 
Around line 50 we can just remove the following details. 
```{r remove directions, eval = F}
\begingroup
\begin{spacing}{0.1}
{\scriptsize `r data$Directions_BL`}
\end{spacing}
\endgroup
```

Delete this!

![Space between habitat and vegetation](../man/figures/Spaced-SOS-2823-1.png)

That looks better! But now that we can, I want to open up some space between the habitat notes and vegetation information. 
It's simple, all we need is to empty a blank line to the document

```{r add a space, eval = F}
\begingroup
`r data$Gen`. `r writer(data$Site)` `r data$latitude_dd` `r data$longitude_dd` (`r data$Datum` `r writer(data$Coordinate_Uncertainty)`).

`r writer(data$Habitat)`. `r data$physical_environ`  
Veg.: `r species_font(data$Vegetation)` `r associates_writer(data$Associates)`
`r writer(data$Notes)`  
\endgroup
```

Can become the chunk below. All we do is enter a blank line between 'r writer()...' and 'Veg.'

```{r add a space do it, eval = F}
\begingroup
`r data$Gen`. `r writer(data$Site)` `r data$latitude_dd` `r data$longitude_dd` (`r data$Datum` `r writer(data$Coordinate_Uncertainty)`).

`r writer(data$Habitat)`. `r data$physical_environ`  

Veg.: `r species_font(data$Vegetation)` `r associates_writer(data$Associates)`
`r writer(data$Notes)`  
\endgroup
```

![Space between habitat and vegetation](../man/figures/Spaced-SOS-2823-1.png)

That's better!

> "All I want is to breathe I'm too thin 
Won't you breathe with me?
Find a little space, so we can move in-between In-Between it
And keep one step ahead, of yourself."

Now let's change the line that controls the size of the font for the project name. 
Here we will no longer be forcing the project name to UPPERCASE large font, and instead allow it to follow the cases we provided it with. 

```{r upper case project, eval = F}
\textbf{\LARGE `r writer(data$Project_Name)`}  
```

```{r title case project, eval = F}
\textbf{\large `r writer(data$Project_Name)`} 
```

![Project name is smaller](../man/figures/large-SOS-2823-1.png)

Let's change the location of the family on the label. Let's place it at the end of the species name, but still right aligned. 
Note that all calls to R are in a single set of smart quotes, and 'R', this allows us to run R commands without having to create a code chunk for them in the more common markdown syntax. 
We have created a few commands which help format the writing output for making the labels like nice. 

```{r family at right, eval = F}
\begin{flushright}
\uppercase{`r data$Family`}
\end{flushright}

\begingroup
\large
`r writer(paste(data$Genus, data$Epithet), italics = TRUE)` `r writer(data$Binomial_authority)` `r writer(data$Infrarank)` `r  writer(data$Infraspecies, italics = TRUE)` `r writer(data$Infraspecific_authority)`  
\endgroup
\normalsize
```

Can be combined like this: 

```{r family at left, eval = F}

\large
\uppercase{`r data$Family`}  
\begingroup
`r writer(paste(data$Genus, data$Epithet), italics = TRUE)` `r writer(data$Binomial_authority)` `r writer(data$Infrarank)` `r  writer(data$Infraspecies, italics = TRUE)` `r writer(data$Infraspecific_authority)`  
\endgroup
\normalsize

```

This requires us to delete the first three lines while we copy them down into the 'group'. 
Which brings up a good point, these 'groups' are used to more or less create elements held together like paragraphs. 

![Family to the left](../man/figures/familyLeft-SOS-2823-1.png)

We may also decide that we want to put determination information right under the species. 
We can do that by just moving these elements around.
(Be sure to delete the call to `writer_fide` from the chunk located all the way near the bottom of the skeleton!).

```{r determination, eval=F}
\begingroup
`r collection_writer(data)`. `r writer_fide(data)`
\endgroup
```

And bring it up to where the scientific name is printed, and make the font for the det info smaller. 

```{r remove fide, eval=F}
\begingroup
\large
`r writer(paste(data$Genus, data$Epithet), italics = TRUE)` `r writer(data$Binomial_authority)` `r writer(data$Infrarank)` `r  writer(data$Infraspecies, italics = TRUE)` `r writer(data$Infraspecific_authority)`  
\normalsize
`r writer_fide(data)`
\endgroup
```

![Moved determination](../man/figures/Det-SOS-2823-1.png)
Obviously, the way I enter data for determination would be bad for this! using my initials after my full name makes sense, in this context, who the hell is "RCB" you would wonder? I am one in a sea of botanists named 'Reed', and certainly other - more illustrious - RCB's are out there. 

## In summary 

This is an odd vignette to create because it relies on multiple languages, especially one where ' ' spaces are *very* important. 
Just bear in mind you can make big changes to labels with small steps (maybe too small?)!
The overleaf guide has https://www.overleaf.com/learn everything you need, and you'll probably realize this pales in comparision.
