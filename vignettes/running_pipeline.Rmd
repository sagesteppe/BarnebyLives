# Purpose 
The purpose of this script is to assist botanical collectors in accessioning their collections. 
It is the central component of this entire package. 
Here we will go over ensuring that values which will be printed onto herbarium labels and uploaded into databases are accurate. 

It is our experience that many herbaria now request digital copies of collection information in their own format. 
This script aims to alleviate the investment in time this requires, and in doing so allow the collector more time to do less onerous tasks; such as collection and study. 

While in theory all of the tasks in this script could be automated, doing so neglect the opinions of local taxonomic authorities. 
While several database options for updating collections (and spell checking names) which are current and well curated (e.g. Kew Plants of the World) exist, we feel many proposals and combinations require interpretation by those in the regions attempting to understand the material at hand. 

This script will perform the following tasks.  

### Geographic

**1)** Convert coordinates to a Decimal Degrees format, if needed (e.g. from DMS 72*17.55 -> 72.29861).  
**2)** Retrieve appropriate political place names. (i.e. State, County).  
**3)** Retrieve accurate elevation values of coordinates.  
**4)** Retrieve Public Land Ownership (e.g. United States Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management).  
**5)** Project coordinates from one system to another, if needed (e.g. from an UTM zone to WGS84).  
**6)** Retrieve Cadastral data from the PLSS for Township, Range, Section (TRS)  

### Temporal

**1)** Provide a 'written' date in the style of choosing. (e.g. 12th May 2021), for the purpose of labeling.

### Taxonomic

**1)** Provide a 'spell check' for family.  
**2)** Provide a 'spell check' for genus.  
**3)** Provide a 'spell check' for epithet.  
**4)** Provide a 'spell check' for authorities.  
**5)** In addition you may check for synonymy at each of these taxonomic levels, and accept or reject suggestions.  

### Directions  

I preface this with the observation that a good deal of collectors and curators consider these data non-essential now. 
Regardless, if you are so inclined to gain access to a free google maps account these services are provided. 

**1)** Write directions, from a town of notable size or repute, to the closet parking spot to the collection locality.

Note that these directions may not reflect the actual route traveled by the collectors, but rather what Google Maps thinks is optimal - at the time of the query. *Caveat emptor.*

# Usage

Files required to use this script:

- PAD-US database for retrieving land ownership information if needed (*note does not include identities of Private owners*). 
- World Flora Online static copy of the database.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
# devtools::install_github('sagesteppe/BarnebyLives')
library(tidyverse)
library(BarnebyLives)
```

load data 

```{r load through google sheets, eval = F}
df <- uncleaned_collection_examples
```

## Ensure Coordinates and Dates and formatted appropriately

Date parsing, e.g. convert date into congruent museum formats (month in roman numerals, or spelled out).
This step assumes that you are recording your dates in the American format of (month/day/year), rather than the internationally more common format (day/month/year).
We will also parse out the day of month, month of year, and year, which is used in multiple possible downstream software.

```{r Date parsing, eval = F}
data <- date_parser(df, coll_date = 'Date_digital', det_date = 'Determined_date')

dplyr::select(data, starts_with('Date')) %>% 
  utils::head()
```

### Conversion of Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS) to Decimal Degrees (DD). 
The DMS format is still used in a few applications we will convert this to the more generally utilized DD format. 
We will maintain both formats in the data set, so others have them readily available for other uses aside from creating herbarium labels. 

```{r Conversion of Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS) to Decimal Degrees (DD), eval = F}
data <- dms2dd(data, dms = F)

dplyr::select(data, starts_with(c('latitude', 'longitude'))) %>% 
  utils::head()
```

Several spreadsheet software auto-increment numeric columns by default.
We try to identify that issue here. 
```{r check for autofill on coords, eval = F}
data <- autofill_checker(data)

dplyr::select(data, Long_AutoFill_Flag, Lat_AutoFill_Flag) |> 
  tidyr::drop_na() |>
  utils::head()
```

For internal usage and data acquisition we will make data set explicitly spatial, rather than just holding coordinates in a column. 
This is also required to write out data in a format readable by Google Earth or another Geographic Information System. 

```{r Make dataset explicitly spatial, eval = F}
data <- coords2sf(data)
head(data) # now we can see that it is an sf object
```

## Retrieve Political/Administrative Information

BarnebyLives! will retrieve various components of both political and administrative information. All of these data which include: The *state*, and *county* of collection, and the *township, range, section (TRS)* from the Public Land Survey System (PLSS). 
It will also determine whether a Federal or State Agency manages or owns the land which were collected from, and if so return the name of it. 
If either the United States Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management does manage the land, it will return information on grazing allotments.

Retrieve State, County, Ownership, TRS, and allotment information
```{r Retrieve Political, eval = F}
p <- '/media/steppe/hdd/Barneby_Lives-dev/geodata'

data <- political_grabber(data, y = 'Collection_number', path = p)
```

## Geographic Information for Locality info

Many younger collectors use Site Names which are quite broad, we advocate for the usage of locality names.  

A locality name is going to provide the relation between a site and the actual collection area through a distance and azimuth.
All of the sites which we use as prospective identifiers are from the Geographic Names Information System, these names have undergone standardization, and general cleaning up to better reflect currently acceptable naming practices (i.e. misogynistic and racist names have largely - if not entirely - been removed). 
Using GNIS allows for places to be unambiguously related to each other. 
While I hate saying that a collection site is XX km from a river at 121 degrees, because well - just think about it, that seems to be what people want. 

Retrieve Nearest GNIS place name, and azimuth from it.
```{r Retrieve Place and location from it, eval = F}
data <- site_writer(data, path = p)
```

## Site characteristics

BarnebyLives acquires a range of characteristics which are useful to describe the physical environment, these are: elevation (both meters and feet), slope, aspect, surficial geology, and geomorphons.  

Here are some details on some of the data sets which we are using. 
All elevation data come from [DEM90](https://www.earthenv.org/DEM), as the name implies this data set is at roughly 90 meters of roughly in the X and Y dimensions. 
This product is then used to derive both slope (in degrees) and aspect (in degrees) information. 
Slope conveys the change in elevation between adjacent cells, while aspect discusses which way water would flow downslope. 
An aspect of East states that water would flow downslope to the east. 
Surficial geology data are acquired from the United States Geological Survey, it works very well for characterizing major geology types in an area, although you may be on a minor inclusion within that material. 
Geomorphons are a bit more peculiar, they may refer to several things, but here they refer to [10 standardized landform positions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169555X12005028) [Geomorpho90m](https://portal.opentopography.org/dataspace/dataset?opentopoID=OTDS.012020.4326.1), which are useful for characterizing landform position. 
These are useful for spatial ecology and describe where on the landscape the population was broadly located. 

```{r, eval = F}
data <- physical_grabber(data, path = p)
```

## Taxonomic

BarnebyLives performs multiple operations related to taxonomy and nomenclature.
The function **spell_check()**, will attempt to determine whether the supplied binomial scientific name, and family are spelled correctly and offer suggestions if they are not. 

This function requires that the first few letters of the generic name and epithet are spelled correctly. 
It will run a spell check against nearly all published plant name spellings, and search for the most similar spelling within these lists if material is not found. 
It will operate on both pieces of the binomial separately, and can work to identify the species within the context of genus. 

```{r check spelling of binomial and family, eval = F}
p <- '/media/steppe/hdd/Barneby_Lives-dev/taxonomic_data'
data <- spell_check(data, path = p)

data <- spell_check(data = data, column = 'Full_name', path = p)
data <- family_spell_check(data, path = p)
```

A similar check is to determine that the author whom is cited for describing the species, or transferring it to another genus, is spelled using the standard author abbreviations.
This check operates under a similar manner to **spell_check()**.
The list which is consults *is* comprehensive, within a few years, of all taxonomists whom have published plant species. 

```{r check spelling of author, eval = F}
data <- author_check(data, path = p)
```

The final process in the taxonomic step is to ensure that the spellings of any species noted in the *vegetation*, or *associates* fields are accurate. 
These *will not* then be submitted to Kew, as the fields could quickly overwhelm the API. 

```{r check spellings of vegetation and associated species, eval = F}
data <- associates_spell_check(data, 'Associates', path = p) # we can run on both columns. 
data <- associates_spell_check(data, 'Vegetation', path = p)
```

Remove the collected species from associated species lists.
Many collectors include the focal collection when performing data entry.

```{r drop focal species from associated species, eval = F}
data <- associate_dropper(data, 'Full_name', col  = 'Associates')
data <- associate_dropper(data, 'Full_name', col  = 'Vegetation')
```

After BarnebyLives verifies spelling, it submits names to Plants of the World Online to check for synonymy. 
BL will not automatically overwrite your submitted species - interpretation of results is important, especially as *spell_check* may occasionally mis-match material.

```{r Search for synonyms to species, eval = F}
names <- sf::st_drop_geometry(data) %>% 
  pull(Full_name)

pow_res <- lapply(names,
      powo_searcher) %>% 
  bind_rows()
data <- bind_cols(data, pow_res)

rm(names, pow_res)
```

## Directions

Directions to a parking spot can be acquired from Google Maps; however this implies the location can be driven to in the first place. 
This may require interactive alterations from the user.

```{r site directions, eval = F}
SoS_gkey = Sys.getenv("Sos_gkey")
directions <- directions_grabber(data, api_key = SoS_gkey)
```

# Export collections

We can also export collections as either (or both!) a 'shapefile' or KML for use in GIS or GoogleEarth.
```{r write out collections in a spatial data format, eval = F}
geodata_writer(data, path = 'someplace', 
               filename = 'Herbarium_Collections_2023',
               filetype = 'kml')
```
