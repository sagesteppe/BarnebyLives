# Alternative Data Sources

BarnebyLives relies on considerable amounts of data developed, maintained, and downloaded from the US Federal Government. 
However, concerns over the availability of spatial data from the US Federal Government exist. 
Here we list the sources of data used by BL, indicating which are sourced directly from the federal government, and when possible list alternatives which may need to be used as drop in replacements. 

Please note that because BL utilizes local compute, these data sources being removed by the Federal government will not effect existing instances.
