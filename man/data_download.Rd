\arguments{
\item{path}{The root directory to save all the data in. Please specify a location,
we suggest you make a directory for this.
If not specified will default to your working directory.}

\item{PADUS}{Boolean. Defaults to FALSE. Honestly, downloading this single

https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/652ef930d34edd15305a9b03 you'll have to
do a captcha, but just download the 'Geodatabase.zip' and place it in same
directory as other files. Rename it as 'PADUS.zip' and we are good to go.}

\description{
this function will download the data which are required to set up an instance of BarnebyLives.
These data must then be processed by the \code{data_process} function to set up the directory structures appropriately.
Note that the function will test if the data already exist in the location, if they do they will not be downloaded again.

Elevation data are available at http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/MERIT_DEM/
and require a free and automatically approved account to download.
Download from the second set of data, under the 'GeoTiff format' header
