\title{a function to subset the WCVP data set to an area of focus}
\usage{
TaxUnpack(path, bound)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character vector. Location to where taxonomic data should be saved,
we recommend a subdirectory in the same folder, and at the same level, as the geographic data.}

\item{bound}{Dataframe of x and y coordinates, same argument as to \code{data_setup}.
Coordinates assumed in WG84, NAD83, or googles absurd projection. Coordinate
specifications are very precise later in the process, but at this level any of these
three are effectively equivalent.}
}
\description{
This function is run on the WCVP compressed archive downloaded by 'wcvp_update',
and requires some input from the user which specifies a geographic area to establish a
taxonomic look up table for.
